## 🌐 Introdution

Script Lab, you can create Bitcoin scripts easily and intuitively. Start by asking our chat to generate a basic script or create your own by dragging and dropping blocks. Each block displays the corresponding opcode, making it easy to visualize the code. When you're done, you'll see the complete script, ready to use. All this without having to code, quickly and intuitively.

## Version Incomplete

Due to the complexity of the block system, this version is not the final version, the final version is in figma.
